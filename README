Radblog is an easy to use, install, and configure Radiant CMS blog with standard
functionality for any blogger. Because its so easy to get up and running quickly,
you'll be blogging in no time at all after you unpack, populate database with standard
stuff, and answer a few questions as part of the setup process.

Thank you for your interest in Radblog! If you have any questions/problems, please feel
free to contact me. I will do my very best to answer any questions the documentation is
lacking.
